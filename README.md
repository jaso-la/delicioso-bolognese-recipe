<h3>What is bolognese?</h3> 
  Bolognese is a meat sauce originating from Italy. Outside of Italy, most people know bolognese as a tomato sauce with meat in it. This is wrong and an angry Italian man will find you if you ever make bolognese like that. Traditionally ,     it's a meat sauce with a small amount of tomato. It typically contains a soffritto of onions, celery, and carrots; along with minced beef and pork, <strong>WHITE WINE</strong>, tomato paste, and milk. 
<br>
Fun fact: traditionally, only salt and pepper are used as seasoning. There are no herbs either (although bay leaves may be traditional. I don't know. I'm just some kid doing a comp sci project).
</p>

<p>
Bolognese is typically served in lasagna or over a thick pasta like tagliatelle. You can try putting it over spaghetti, but you will incur the wrath of a thousand Italians.
