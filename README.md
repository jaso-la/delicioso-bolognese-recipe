  Oh boy do I love bolognese. 
<br><br>
<h3>What is bolognese?</h3> 
  Bolognese is a meat sauce originating from Italy. Outside of Italy, most people know bolognese as a tomato sauce with meat in it. This is wrong and an angry Italian man will find you if you ever make bolognese like that. Instead of being a tomato sauce with meat, it's a meat sauce with tomato. It typically contains a soffritto of onions, celery, and carrots; along with minced beef and pork, <strong>WHITE WINE</strong>, tomatoes and tomato paste, and whole milk. 
<br>
Fun fact: traditionally, only salt and pepper are used as seasoning. Not even any garlic! I won't tell anyone if you use garlic though. There are no herbs either (although bay leaves may be authentic. I don't know. I'm just some kid doing a comp sci project).
</p>

<p>
Bolognese is typically served in lasagna or over a thick pasta like tagliatelle. You can try putting it over spaghetti, but you will incur the wrath of a thousand Italians.

    <li>Add the chopped vegetables and deglaze with white wine. Add tomato paste, pancetta, and the questionably authentic bay leaf.</li>  <img src="deglaze.png" alt="deglazing with white wine" width="564" height="366"/> <br><br>
    <li>Let the sauce simmer until you lose patience, ideally 2-3 hours. Add stock or water if the sauce is getting dry.</li>
    <li>In the last few minutes of cooking, add milk. </li>
  </ol>
